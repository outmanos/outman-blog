blurb: "I'll be using this blog to discuss topics that I think are interesting. So expect posts about programming, general technology and software, music theory and analysis, economics and architecture."

    heading: "Introduction"
    text: "My name is Outman. My full-time job is programming, and I write music as a hobby. I also enjoy spending time outdoors every now and then. I primarily work with C#, but I explore various other technologies whenever I get the chance. Lately, I've developed an interest in Go, and after years of inactivity in blogging, I decided to give HUGO a shot. So far, I find it much nicer for my own needs than Ghost, which I used previously on a Vultr VPS. Now, I'm using GitHub, HUGO, Netlify, and Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) to run this blog for free. The only thing I still pay for, of course, is my domain."
